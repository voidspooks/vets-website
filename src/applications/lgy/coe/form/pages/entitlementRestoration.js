        <p className="vads-u-margin-y--0">
          You can request an entitlement restoration to refinance your home and
          cash out part of your equity. Entitlement restoration will only apply
          to the home that you bought with your VA home loan entitlement.{' '}

          Refinance to change my interest rate
        </p>
        <p className="vads-u-margin-y--0">
          You can refinance your current VA home loan to get a lower interest
          rate with the Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan (IRRRL)
          program. You can also use this program to switch from an adjustable
          rate to a fixed rate. Your entitlement will be re-used with this
          program.

        </p>
        <p className="vads-u-margin-top--0">
          Regular restorations of entitlement require a prior VA loan to be paid
          in full and the property to be no longer owned by the Veteran. There
          is no limit to the number of regular restorations a Veteran can
          receive.

          You can receive a one-time restoration if you’ve repaid the VA loan in
          full, but plan to keep the home. You can only do a one-time
          restoration once in your lifetime.
